1. You are expected to submit the steps you followed for doing all the below subtasks.

• Use the "Sales_Data.xml" file.

Use Sales_data.xml file 

• Access the "xml" file in excel and save it to a comma delimited "csv" file.

Import an XML data file as an XML table

  1.  Click Developer > Import.

	    If you don't see the Developer tab, see Show the Developer tab.

  2.  In the Import XML dialog box, locate and select the XML data file (.xml) you want to import, and click Import.

	    If the XML data file doesn't refer to a schema, Excel infers the schema from the XML data file.

  3.  In the Import Data dialog box, do the following:

	    Select XML table in existing worksheet to import the contents of the XML data file into an XML table in your worksheet at the specified cell location.

SaveAs the file with CSV extension.


• Make all the rows where "attractiveness<6" to

	• background color = red, font = 8, font type = italic.

	Select the "attractiveness" column, Go to the home tab & select "Conditional Formatting 

	Select "New Rule" then click on "Format only cell that contain" in the "Edit the rule description"

	Select "less than" in the second drop down & =6 in the third box

	Click on the "Format" & change the "background color = red and font type = italic" we can't change the font size & font face using
	conditional formatting it can be done using VBA macro.



• Hide All the rows where "attractiveness<6" by using grouping. Hide in the sense, we should be able to see there is some rows there, which we can unfold to see. Also try hiding the data without grouping.


	Go to "Data" then sort the column with "attractiveness" Select the data with "attractiveness<6" go to the "Data" tab and click "Group" it will ask row/column wise select row wise.


	Without grouping, select the row with attractiveness<6 then right click & hide the cells.

• Use the same data. The column named "attractiveness" is in general format. It is actually a rating from 1 to 10. Can you prepend "C" before the number. i.e. if it is 1, it should be converted to "C1". Format the column to text type.


	For prepend "C" before number we can use formula "=CONCATENATE("C",D2)" in the cell & copy it to the entire column.

	Change the format of the cell by pressing ctrl+1 to open the "format cells" dialog box & change the format to text type.
